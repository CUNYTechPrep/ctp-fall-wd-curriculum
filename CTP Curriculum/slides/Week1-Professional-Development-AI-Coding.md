# Agile Development Fundamentals

---

## How Professional Teams Work

### The Agile Methodology

- **Sprint Planning** - Define 2-week deliverables
- **Daily Standups** - 15-minute progress sync
- **Retrospectives** - Continuous improvement
- **User Stories** - Customer-focused features

---

## Sprint Planning

### Breaking Down Work

```
Epic: Expense Tracking Application
├── Sprint 1: Basic UI Components
├── Sprint 2: State Management
├── Sprint 3: Backend Integration
└── Sprint 4: Deployment & Polish
```

### Estimation & Commitment
- Story points, not hours
- T-Shirt Sizing issues
- Team capacity planning
- Definition of done

---

## Daily Standups

### The Three Questions

1. ✅ What did I complete yesterday?
2. 🚧 What am I working on today?
3. 🚫 What blockers do I have?

### Why It Matters
- Accountability
- Early problem detection
- Team synchronization

---

## User Stories

### Customer-Focused Development

**Format:**
```
As a [type of user]
I want [feature/functionality]
So that [benefit/value]
```

**Example:**
```
As a college student
I want to categorize my expenses
So that I can see where I'm overspending
```

# Professional Documentation

---

## Documentation = Team Success

### The Hidden Multiplier

- 📉 Poor docs = Slower Onboarding
- 📈 Good docs = New developers are productive more quickly
- 🔄 Self-documenting code is not enough
- 💡 "Good documentation is the difference between legacy code and maintainable systems"

---

## README Excellence

### Essential Sections

```markdown
# Project Name

## 🎯 Overview
What problem does this solve?

## 🚀 Quick Start
How to run in < 5 minutes

## 📚 Documentation
Architecture, API, decisions

## 🤝 Contributing
How to help
```

---

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### Document the "Why"

```markdown
# ADR-001: Use TypeScript

## Context
We need type safety for financial data...

## Decision
Use TypeScript with strict mode

## Consequences
✅ Catch errors at compile time
❌ Initial learning curve

## Related Decisions
- [Title of ADR](ADR-002)
```

---

# CodeSpaces & Cloud Development

---

## Welcome to the Cloud IDE

### No More "Works on My Machine"

- ☁️ Consistent development environment
- 🚀 Zero setup time
- 👥 Same tools for entire team
- 🔧 Pre-configured with everything you need

### Live Demo Time! 

---

## CodeSpaces Benefits

- **Instant Onboarding**
  - New team member coding in 5 minutes
  - Not 5 days of setup

- **Consistency**
  - Same Node version
  - Same extensions
  - Same configuration
  - Work from any device

---

# GitHub Copilot

---

## AI as Your Pair Programmer

### The Right Mental Model

> "Copilot is your pair programmer, not your replacement"
---
### What It's Great For:
- ✅ Boilerplate code
- ✅ Test generation
- ✅ Learning new APIs
- ✅ Syntax reminders
---
### What It's NOT For:
- ❌ Critical business logic
- ❌ Security-sensitive code
- ❌ Avoiding learning

---

## Copilot Best Practices

### Write Intent First

```javascript
// Good: Clear intent, then let Copilot help
// TODO: Create a function that validates email format
// Requirements: Check for @ symbol, domain, and valid characters

// Copilot assists with implementation details
function validateEmail(email) {
  // AI helps here...
}
```
---
### Always Verify
- Understand every line
- Check edge cases
- Validate against requirements

---

## Live Copilot Demo

### Good Usage Example

```javascript
// TODO: Create Express server with middleware
// Requirements:
// - JSON parsing
// - CORS enabled
// - Port from environment variable

// Watch Copilot suggest...
```

### Poor Usage Example

```javascript
// Create user authentication system

// DON'T blindly accept complex security code!
```
