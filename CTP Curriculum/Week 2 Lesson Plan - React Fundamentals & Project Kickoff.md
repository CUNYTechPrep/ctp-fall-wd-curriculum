## LAUNCH (10 minutes)

### Hook:
"Today you become React developers! By the end of this session, you'll build interactive components and form teams around projects you're passionate about. React powers Facebook, Netflix, Airbnb, and countless other applications - and now it will power yours."

### React Mental Model Activity:

**Interactive Demonstration (5 min):**
- Show a complex UI (like Twitter/X feed)
- "Let's decompose this into components:"
  - Feed Container
  - Tweet Card
  - User Avatar
  - Like Button
  - Reply Thread
- "Each piece is independent but works together"

**Think-Pair-Share (5 min):**
- **Think:** "How would you break down Instagram's interface into components?"
- **Pair:** Quick discussion with neighbor
- **Share:** Instructor draws component tree from suggestions

### Connection to Prior Learning:
"Last week you set up professional development practices. Today we apply them by building real React components with proper documentation, using Copilot responsibly, and forming teams using the agile principles we learned."

## LECTURE: React Core Concepts (20 minutes)

### Learning Target:
Students will understand React's component-based architecture and modern development patterns

### Instructional Strategy: Progressive Concept Building with Visual Models

### Presentation Content Structure:

**React Philosophy & Architecture (5 minutes)**
- **Component-Based Thinking:**
  ```
  UI = f(state)
  "Your UI is a function of your application state"
  ```
- **Virtual DOM Concept:**
  - React maintains virtual representation
  - Calculates minimal changes needed
  - Updates only what changed
  - Result: Fast, efficient rendering
- **Declarative vs Imperative:**
  - Imperative: "Find the button, add a click handler, update the text"
  - Declarative: "When clicked, the count should be X"
- **Industry context:** "This mental model is why React developers are so productive"

**Component Fundamentals (7 minutes)**
- **Functional Components:**
  ```jsx
  // Modern React - This is what you'll write
  function ExpenseCard({ amount, category, date }) {
    return (
      <div className="expense-card">
        <h3>{category}</h3>
        <p>${amount}</p>
        <time>{date}</time>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```
- **JSX Explained:**
  - Looks like HTML but it's JavaScript
  - `className` instead of `class`
  - `onClick` instead of `onclick`
  - JavaScript expressions in `{}`
  - Must return single parent element
- **Component Composition:**
  ```jsx
  function ExpenseList() {
    return (
      <div>
        <ExpenseCard amount={50} category="Food" />
        <ExpenseCard amount={100} category="Transport" />
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

**Props: Component Communication (4 minutes)**
- **Props as Function Arguments:**
  ```jsx
  // Props are just function parameters
  function Button({ text, onClick, variant = "primary" }) {
    return (
      <button 
        className={`btn btn-${variant}`}
        onClick={onClick}
      >
        {text}
      </button>
    );
  }
  ```
- **Props Rules:**
  - Props are read-only (immutable)
  - Flow down from parent to child
  - Can be any JavaScript value
  - Destructuring makes code cleaner

**State: Making Components Interactive (4 minutes)**
- **The useState Hook:**
  ```jsx
  function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
          Increment
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```
- **State Rules:**
  - State is private to component
  - Changing state triggers re-render
  - Never mutate state directly
  - Use setter function always
- **When to Use State:**
  - User input (forms, interactions)
  - API responses
  - UI state (open/closed, selected)

### Visual Elements:
- Component tree diagrams
- Props flow visualization (parent â†’ child)
- State update cycle animation
- Before/after render comparisons

### Engagement Techniques:
- "What happens if we try to modify props directly?"
- "When would a component need state vs just props?"
- "How is this different from vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation?"

## I DO BLOCK 1: Component Building Demo (20 minutes)

### Learning Target:
Demonstrate building production-quality React components with professional patterns

### Demonstration Sequence:

**Setup & File Structure (3 min)**
```bash
# In CodeSpaces expense tracker
src/
  components/
    ExpenseCard/
      ExpenseCard.jsx
      ExpenseCard.css
    ExpenseList/
      ExpenseList.jsx
      ExpenseList.css
```
- Think-aloud: "I organize components in folders - this scales better than flat structure"

**Build ExpenseCard Component (8 min)**
```jsx
// ExpenseCard.jsx
import './ExpenseCard.css';

/**
 * Displays a single expense item
 * @param {Object} props
 * @param {number} props.amount - Expense amount in dollars
 * @param {string} props.category - Expense category
 * @param {string} props.description - Expense description
 * @param {string} props.date - Expense date
 */
function ExpenseCard({ amount, category, description, date }) {
  // Format currency for display
  const formattedAmount = new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {
    style: 'currency',
    currency: 'USD'
  }).format(amount);

  // Format date for display
  const formattedDate = new Date(date).toLocaleDateString();

  // Determine color based on amount
  const amountClass = amount > 100 ? 'expense-high' : 'expense-normal';

  return (
    <article className="expense-card">
      <div className="expense-header">
        <span className="expense-category">{category}</span>
        <time className="expense-date">{formattedDate}</time>
      </div>
      <div className="expense-body">
        <p className="expense-description">{description}</p>
        <p className={`expense-amount ${amountClass}`}>
          {formattedAmount}
        </p>
      </div>
    </article>
  );
}

export default ExpenseCard;
```
- Think-aloud during coding:
  - "Notice the JSDoc comments - Copilot can use these"
  - "I'm using semantic HTML - article for a self-contained item"
  - "Formatting logic stays in the component"
  - "Conditional styling based on business logic"

**Add Professional Styling (5 min)**
```css
/* ExpenseCard.css */
.expense-card {
  background: white;
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 16px;
  margin-bottom: 12px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  transition: transform 0.2s, box-shadow 0.2s;
}

.expense-card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}

.expense-header {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  margin-bottom: 8px;
}

.expense-category {
  background: #4F46E5;
  color: white;
  padding: 4px 8px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  font-size: 12px;
  font-weight: 600;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

.expense-amount {
  font-size: 24px;
  font-weight: bold;
}

.expense-amount.expense-high {
  color: #DC2626;
}

.expense-amount.expense-normal {
  color: #059669;
}
```

**Create Container Component (4 min)**
```jsx
// ExpenseList.jsx
import ExpenseCard from '../ExpenseCard/ExpenseCard';
import './ExpenseList.css';

function ExpenseList() {
  // Temporary mock data - will come from state later
  const expenses = [
    {
      id: 1,
      amount: 45.99,
      category: 'Food',
      description: 'Lunch at cafe',
      date: '2024-01-15'
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      amount: 120.00,
      category: 'Transport',
      description: 'Monthly metro card',
      date: '2024-01-14'
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      amount: 25.50,
      category: 'Entertainment',
      description: 'Movie tickets',
      date: '2024-01-13'
    }
  ];

  return (
    <div className="expense-list">
      <h2>Recent Expenses</h2>
      {expenses.map(expense => (
        <ExpenseCard
          key={expense.id}
          amount={expense.amount}
          category={expense.category}
          description={expense.description}
          date={expense.date}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

export default ExpenseList;
```
- Think-aloud: "Always use key prop in lists - React needs it for efficient updates"

### Professional Insights:
- "This component structure is how we build at scale"
- "Props make components reusable across your app"
- "Separation of concerns - each component has one job"

## YOU DO BLOCK 1: First Components (15 minutes)

## BREAK (10 minutes)

## I DO BLOCK 2: Props and State Demo (15 minutes)

### Learning Target:
Demonstrate state management and prop passing to create interactive components

### Demonstration Sequence:

**Adding State to ExpenseList (7 min)**
```jsx
// Enhanced ExpenseList.jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import ExpenseCard from '../ExpenseCard/ExpenseCard';
import ExpenseForm from '../ExpenseForm/ExpenseForm';
import './ExpenseList.css';

function ExpenseList() {
  // State for managing expenses
  const [expenses, setExpenses] = useState([
    {
      id: 1,
      amount: 45.99,
      category: 'Food',
      description: 'Lunch at cafe',
      date: '2024-01-15'
    }
  ]);

  // State for filter
  const [filterCategory, setFilterCategory] = useState('All');

  // Calculate total
  const total = expenses.reduce((sum, expense) => sum + expense.amount, 0);

  // Filter expenses
  const filteredExpenses = filterCategory === 'All' 
    ? expenses 
    : expenses.filter(e => e.category === filterCategory);

  // Add new expense
  const addExpense = (newExpense) => {
    setExpenses([...expenses, { 
      ...newExpense, 
      id: Date.now() 
    }]);
  };

  // Delete expense
  const deleteExpense = (id) => {
    setExpenses(expenses.filter(e => e.id !== id));
  };

  return (
    <div className="expense-list">
      <div className="expense-summary">
        <h2>Total: ${total.toFixed(2)}</h2>
        <select 
          value={filterCategory} 
          onChange={(e) => setFilterCategory(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option>All</option>
          <option>Food</option>
          <option>Transport</option>
          <option>Entertainment</option>
        </select>
      </div>

      <ExpenseForm onAddExpense={addExpense} />

      {filteredExpenses.map(expense => (
        <ExpenseCard
          key={expense.id}
          {...expense}
          onDelete={() => deleteExpense(expense.id)}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```
- Think-aloud: 
  - "State holds our data, props pass it down"
  - "Never mutate state directly - always create new arrays/objects"
  - "Callbacks (like onDelete) let children communicate up"

**Creating Interactive Form (8 min)**
```jsx
// ExpenseForm.jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import './ExpenseForm.css';

function ExpenseForm({ onAddExpense }) {
  // Form state
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    amount: '',
    category: 'Food',
    description: '',
    date: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]
  });

  // Handle input changes
  const handleChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    setFormData(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      [name]: value
    }));
  };

  // Handle form submission
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    
    // Validate
    if (!formData.amount || !formData.description) {
      alert('Please fill in all fields');
      return;
    }

    // Convert amount to number
    onAddExpense({
      ...formData,
      amount: parseFloat(formData.amount)
    });

    // Reset form
    setFormData({
      amount: '',
      category: 'Food',
      description: '',
      date: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]
    });
  };

  return (
    <form className="expense-form" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input
        type="number"
        name="amount"
        value={formData.amount}
        onChange={handleChange}
        placeholder="Amount"
        step="0.01"
        required
      />
      
      <select 
        name="category" 
        value={formData.category}
        onChange={handleChange}
      >
        <option>Food</option>
        <option>Transport</option>
        <option>Entertainment</option>
        <option>Other</option>
      </select>

      <input
        type="text"
        name="description"
        value={formData.description}
        onChange={handleChange}
        placeholder="Description"
        required
      />

      <input
        type="date"
        name="date"
        value={formData.date}
        onChange={handleChange}
        required
      />

      <button type="submit">Add Expense</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default ExpenseForm;
```
- Think-aloud:
  - "Controlled components - React controls form values"
  - "Single source of truth in state"
  - "Form validation before submission"
  - "Clear form after successful add"

### Key Concepts Emphasized:
- State management patterns
