    <!--
      ROOT DIV

      This div is where React renders the entire application.

      React takes control of this element and manages all content inside it.
      Everything you see is generated by React components.

      The id="root" matches document.getElementById('root') in main.tsx
    -->
    <div id="root"></div>

    <!--
      SCRIPT TAG

      Vite automatically injects the script tag here during development.
      In production build, this becomes a hashed filename for caching.

      type="module":
      - Uses ES modules
      - Enables import/export
      - Supported by all modern browsers
      - Vite handles older browsers via polyfills

      The src points to main.tsx, which is the entry point.
      Vite transforms TypeScript to JavaScript automatically.
    -->
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>

    <!--
      VITE DEVELOPMENT SERVER

      In development, Vite:
      1. Serves this HTML file
      2. Intercepts /src/main.tsx request
      3. Transforms TypeScript to JavaScript on-the-fly
      4. Serves transformed file
      5. Browser loads and runs it
      6. React renders into #root div

      NO BUNDLING in development = instant updates!
    -->

    <!--
      PRODUCTION BUILD

      After npm run build, this becomes:

      <script type="module" src="/assets/main-abc123.js"></script>

      Where abc123 is a hash of the file content.
      This enables:
      - Long-term caching
      - Cache busting when files change
      - Parallel downloads
      - Optimal performance

    <!--
      SEO CONSIDERATIONS

      Search engines see:
      - Just this HTML (nearly empty)
      - No actual content
      - Poor SEO

      This is the trade-off of SPAs!

      Solutions:
      1. Use Next.js for SSR (see other projects)
      2. Prerender with react-snap
      3. Server-side rendering
      4. Or accept it (internal tools don't need SEO)

    <!--
      ACCESSIBILITY

      This HTML includes:
      - lang="en" for screen readers
      - viewport meta for mobile
      - Semantic HTML structure

      Additional accessibility comes from React components
      (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, etc.)
